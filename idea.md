I want to build an email reply agent for gmail.
Use gmail API to fetch everything from primary inbox.
The agent should craft the reply using OpenAI or GeminiAPI.
There should be a supabase database where the knowledge is stored.
Basically we have courses or programs regarding which we will receive emails.
So when the reply is crafted it should refer to the document mentioning the program info.

I need the ability to modify the email drafted by AI before sending 
In the supabase the original email drafted by AI and the one I sent should be stored
The frontend should be deployed on vercel. If backend functions are needed you can use railway.

you should never send an email automatically.
The user should approve with one button click
Implementation authentication so that only the owner of the email has access
The login can be via google login
for every email reply there should be a star rating and textual feedback option that is stored on supabase.
The existing knowledge base in the csv file in the working directory should be converted to a vector database and stored in supabase. You will have to perform RAG to fetch the relevant information fro the vector database
The implementation should happen in phases. So you should plan first, ask my preference and then execute in phases
